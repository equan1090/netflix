                    Denji has a simple dreamâ€”to live a happy and peaceful life, spending time with a girl he likes. This is a far cry from reality, however, as Denji is forced by the yakuza into killing devils
                    in order to pay off his crushing debts. Using his pet devil
                    Pochita as a weapon, he is ready to do anything for a bit of cash.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Unfortunately, he has outlived his usefulness and is murdered
                    by a devil in contract with the yakuza. However, in an unexpected
                    turn of events, Pochita merges with Denji's dead body and grants
                     him the powers of a chainsaw devil. Now able to transform parts
                     of his body into chainsaws, a revived Denji uses his new
                     abilities to quickly and brutally dispatch his enemies.
